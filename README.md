## Description

Provides a small and compact widget that displays the current weather based on the HTML5 [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) and [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/current).

The temperature is displayed in fahrenheit by default but can be changed to celsius or kelvin. The temperature is updated every 10 minutes.
