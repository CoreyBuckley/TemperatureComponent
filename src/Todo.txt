- Make thermometer bar scale with temperature returned from api [X]
- Remark: math scaling in fahrenheit (so other units converted first)
- Make a slider for temperature unit
- More data? Kind of like the compactness though.
- Have colors change on time of day or weather condition?
- Small animations of weather condition
- Maybe indicate time or night / day somehow? [Ability to tell if night is available in updateData.]
- If night, background is dark
    - If cold, background is dark cool colors
    - Elseif hot, background is dark warm colors
- If day, background is bright
    - If cold, background is bright cool colors
    - Elseif hot, background is bright warm colors
- Fix so unit doesn't change on update [X]
- How to deal with text that breaks boundaries? Ex. Long city names. Temp in 100s for F.
- Make one where thermometer fits into container.
- Refresh button? Will fetch temp from remote API and update. (Add debounce so API can't be spammed?)
- Let the user customize the colors themself?
- Have a prop for default unit on the component?
- Popper tooltips for the icons?
- Ticks on the thermometer?
- Refactor CSS -> SCSS for easy configurability?
